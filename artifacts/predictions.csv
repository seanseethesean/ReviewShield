He explained exactly what he was doing, told me when something might feel a little sensitive, and thoroughly went over my x-rays and his suggestion for my next services.

Additionally, she took numerous COVID precautions, including requiring masks covering the nose and mouth of all customers, limiting the number of customers to four (not four “groups” ie households, but four people— full stop.), maintaining an appropriate distance, and ensuring each customer used hand sanitizer upon entering.

"Even after walking by Micho's for the last three years, I've never been tempted to go in until I saw the 4 star rating on Yelp. So, my Monday night dinner buddy and I went here for some good old fast casual Lebanese food. It was a decent experience, but we won't be back. The atmosphere is like most fast casual restaurants with plenty of seating. You can build your own kabob or you can order one they make for you. I had the chicken kabob and it was okay. It has french fries inside, but it lacked significant flavor. Same goes for my baklava ($1.50 for a TINY piece). My buddy got the shawarma, which lacked flavor. He had to order an extra dip to give it some taste to it. All in all it wasn't the worst experience, but we won't be back.",none,none

"This is so far the best Hot and Sour soup I've had in DC, this is a solid Chinese delivery place, I've never stayed in to eat but I'm sure the dishes better served straight from the kitchen would be amazing! Delivery itself is fairly quick for DC as well. I've had many of the standards and they've all been good, my last order however I decided to try Chow Mein for the very first time it was AWESOME, j don't know if this is indictive of the fish though since I've never bothered to order it anywhere else. I usually stick to the Szechuan dishes, but I've had many of the other offerings and liked them as well. The Wonton soup is good, not the best and I've had the egg drop soup, but again it was my first order of it and it was nice, not my cup of tea. This is how I feel about the dishes at any asian place I've been to and tried like hot garlic sauce dishes, I've had it at many places in DC and I just don't like it, but Szechuan house at least has the garlic I can see and the vegetables and meat are fresh.

When I arrived I was promptly greeted and given a short form to complete and I asked the lady if I could check on the baby bird later and i was given a caed with the birds code which I could reference when I called back. I called a few hours later and happily leared that his breed was identified as finch and that after resting and allowing his feathers to dry he was all set and flew out rescue centers doors to join a new family of finches.
