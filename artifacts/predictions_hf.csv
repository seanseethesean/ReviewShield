"It's a little novelty because you can just grab items and leave. I'm a controls engineer and pretty sure Amazon is simple recording everything in store then having a human review and tally purchases. I doubt Amazon is doing this fully autonomously when human labor is so cheap. Some things that are annoying: 1. Only a single small sign that tells you the one tiny button to hit in the Amazon app to display a QR code to gain entry 2. Store was about 50% empty. Most of the produce was gone and many empty shelves 3. Only name brand junk food. 4. Small selection of produce 5. Alcohol section is lacking 6. Prices are a little higher than other locations 7. Amazon doesn't give you a reciept or charge immediately. This further supports my idea that the store is simply reviewing purchases after the fact. Since there's no reciept, and I didn't record the prices for what I purchased there's no way to know if the charge will be accurate. Amazon can increase prices and there's no way to know unless you're prepared. Basically this is a worse version of any convience store. Lack of selection, lack of prepared foods, no idea of the charges. If you're in a hurry, go to a 7/11, CVS, gas station etc. If you are hungry go to a real grocery store. If you want to give Bezos more money to continue to exploit employees and waste it on sub orbital flights with a poorly designed rocket, then go to Amazon Fresh",none,genuine_review,rant without visiting,0.03363848477602005,rant without visiting:0.034;advertisement:0.007;irrelevant:0.001

"The Khalil Gibran Memorial is one of the most obscure memorials in Washington, D.C., but one that's worth a visit if you're nearby.

As you cross a small stone bridge, you read about this Lebanese- American writer/poet. As you wind around the memorial, you read more quotes by him until you get to the center with benches and more quotes. If you're a fan of Gibran, this is a must-visit.

She contacted me when she couldn't find my vision insurance and followed up with me thoroughly up until my appointment just to let me know she was still looking into it and she was doing everything she could to make sure they located my insurance.

Edit: I'm trying to get a return but am told I can't since I bought over 6 months ago. They also refuse to even sell me different contacts until I pay for another examination despite having a current and valid prescription. I understand the reasoning that eyes change, but it's just unreasonable and devious to give someone contacts, admitting they may not work very well and then not allowing one to return. All I want is functional contact lenses. I'm $300 in the hole because I was misled. Malpractice sounds about right.

She was super friendly the whole time and I enjoyed talking to her, and she was a real professional with my nails as well. The salon is kept very clean.

When I arrived I was promptly greeted and given a short form to complete and I asked the lady if I could check on the baby bird later and i was given a caed with the birds code which I could reference when I called back. I called a few hours later and happily leared that his breed was identified as finch and that after resting and allowing his feathers to dry he was all set and flew out rescue centers doors to join a new family of finches.

"U-Haul storage is always good in case of need, but this location has trouble beyond the patience of regular humans. Their system is frozen most of the time, which is discouraging when you have Sat 30th and Sun 31st to move, wasting 3h of your time waiting just to get the storage unit contract, without the possibility of overtime access to the storage unit because it is not available for the storage building. U-Haul is a good addition to my life, but this location isn't",none,genuine_review,advertisement,0.063465416431427,advertisement:0.063;rant without visiting:0.029;irrelevant:0.001
"Horrible experience thru the mobile app for an after-hours pickup and dropoff, on what is supposed to be a seamless process. The app is extremely clunky and regularly doesn't register your clicks to allow you onto the next page. You need to submit all kinds of info upon arrival, not before, so prepare for a lengthy delay at pickup time despite the fact that they could've just had you submit everything earlier. Someone on their end needs to verify it in real-time, including calling a friend or family member just to verify that you indeed exist and are renting a truck. Unsure how this is a real security measure but regardless. Then they gave me the lockbox code to get the truck keys, but the app was so clunky that that page disappeared before I could read it. So I promptly spent the next 20 minutes in the pouring rain on hold with their customer service line, just to get the damn lockbox code. The app thought I'd already started driving, so my only option there was to request roadside assistance (dysfunctional app wouldn't let me submit a request for that either). Add it all up and you've got a terrible user experience.

"OMG...The worst customer service experience ever! Being from the Midwest, I was SO excited to learn that a new Little Caesars was coming to NW DC. Maybe 3 weeks after its grand opening, I paid a visit to this location and I vowed to never return. When 1st entering the store, I was not welcomed by any type of greeting. The girl at the register pretty much stared at me while I was deciding on what to order as if I was holding her up. When inquiring about the Hot and Ready pizzas, I asked how long the pizzas had been sitting out and she said they had just come out the oven. I also asked about the crazy bread and she said the same thing. So I placed my order, received my food and it was very luke warm. I politely asked her if they could make a fresh pizza and set of breadsticks for me and she said , ""These ARE fresh"" with the biggest attitude. So we went back and forth a little bit and eventually she asked the cook to make a fresh order, accompanied by an eye roll. When I got my food, it was the sloppiest thing I had ever seen in life. I then asked her for a refund and she said a manager needed to be there in order for this to happen. I asked her to call the manager if he/she was not there and she claimed they weren't answering the phone. Long story short, I tried calling the store the next day, no response. Then I called district and got a callback right away with refund info and a free pizza offer. I declined the free pizza offer and assured them that I would never return to this particular location again.",none,genuine_review,rant without visiting,0.2890288233757019,rant without visiting:0.289;advertisement:0.123;irrelevant:0.001

"This is so far the best Hot and Sour soup I've had in DC, this is a solid Chinese delivery place, I've never stayed in to eat but I'm sure the dishes better served straight from the kitchen would be amazing! Delivery itself is fairly quick for DC as well. I've had many of the standards and they've all been good, my last order however I decided to try Chow Mein for the very first time it was AWESOME, j don't know if this is indictive of the fish though since I've never bothered to order it anywhere else. I usually stick to the Szechuan dishes, but I've had many of the other offerings and liked them as well. The Wonton soup is good, not the best and I've had the egg drop soup, but again it was my first order of it and it was nice, not my cup of tea. This is how I feel about the dishes at any asian place I've been to and tried like hot garlic sauce dishes, I've had it at many places in DC and I just don't like it, but Szechuan house at least has the garlic I can see and the vegetables and meat are fresh.
