"As one who typically always visited dining options on the ""front"" side of Nats Park, I had the option to park on the 1st base gate side (back) for a game and was pleased to spy Jackie's immediately next to my parking option! The decor has images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (Jackie O) in a stylized mural. The outdoor patio is large and offered (new to me!) Two patio options: tables and couches.

"Seems like there has been some discourse about service, seating, QR codes vs menus. As of April 2021, Jackie is back to as normal of a restaurant experience as you can get. Once at the table, masks can come off, and physical menus are provided (food and drinks). We actually didn't have a reservation, and they seated us outside right away. The well trimmed shrubs created a nice sense of privacy, while not being weird. Our server was EXCELLENT. I have seen some discussion about service in other re",none,nan
The food was absolutely exquisite with unexpectedly delightful flavors and textures. Everything was amazing and we nearly ordered the entire spring menu. Strongly recommend the chicharrones if they are on the menu. Get them with a side of rice and beans both of which are next level as well. The guacamole was smooth and topped with pepitas and served with plantain chips. The duck pastrami toast is a must order item for me when I take new people there. The creamy corn is a lovely combination of el,none,nan
Jackie is the indoor Dacha- Navy Yard rebranded. The design is almost the same with a few extra pieces of Jackie art added. They have tables outside with GQ codes so you never have to interact with staff. You pay through the GR code and someone brings it to your table. Their menu is large. I recommend the Jackie O cocktail for something refreshing and the croquettes are really good!,none,nan

"I see the reviews on food and drinks are generally positive, but ours wasn't. The drinks were ""ok""- I might give them 3 stars. The cornbread was decent- my wife didn't eat it because it was a little dry. The strip steak was very chewy and just didn't have much flavor. I know what strip steak is, but it just wasn't good. The Smores dessert was primarily some type of graham cracker cake with chocolate mixed in parts of it and some marshmallows. Like all of the food, it looked good, but the taste w",none,nan

Expensive: $40 for 2 feed in braids. It was messy and basic looking. I straightened my hair before I got there just so the stylist could jam my hair up with Jam. This style was not worth $40. Let me find the other pic so you can see what the stylist did that I had her take out. You didn't even have the color hair I preferred. Lol thanks for your response tho. Oh and did I mention you. Or whoever the owner is was rude as hell when she arrived. I won't be back.. Nice welcoming!,no_visit_rant,Describes a negative experience but does not indicate a visit to the location.
"I had a bad experience here. I spoke to the owner specifying that I wanted medium waist length knotless braids. The person assigned to me was 45 minutes late. I let that go and stayed. My entire service took about 7 hours - and while the braids were neat, I quickly realized that they actually weren't knotless - the braider still used a thin knot of hair at the root. Not only that, the braids were so heavy and pulling that I couldn't put the braids in a bun! It was my first time getting knotless ",no_visit_rant,Details a complaint about service without evidence of a visit.
